            Leave exceeding two days shall require the prior sanction of the
            Principal/Vice Principal. Those students who are absent on the first
            day of the Academic Session will lose their seat unless a written
            application, stating a sound reason for absence is submitted to the
            Principal well in time and is sanctioned by her.
          </li>
          <li>
            Leave of absence will not ordinarily be granted on the first day of
            the academic session, last day before every vacation and re-opening
            days after summer and winter vacations. In case of an emergency, the
            school authorities must be informed well in time and the leave must
            be sanctioned by the Principal/Vice Principal.
          </li>
          <li>
            In case your ward needs leave, the application should reach the
            school at least one day in advance and for any unforeseen happenings
            or sickness it should reach on the same day before interval.
          </li>
          <li>
            Absence upto 3 days without prior intimation to school debars the
            students from attending the school unless the parents in person
            explain and submit a written application mentioning the reason of
            her absence and non submission of leave application on her joining
            date.
          </li>
          <li>
            In case of medical leave for more than 3 days, a medical certificate
            supported by medical prescription of the concerned hospital from
            which treatment is being taken is to be submitted along with the
            application.
          </li>
          <li>
            Leave on exam days is not granted generally, but in case of any
            unforeseen circumstances parents must meet the Principal/Vice
            Principal either one day prior to the exam or on the day of the exam
            and get the leave sanctioned.
          </li>
          <li>
            Students will not be granted leave on the day before the Summative
            Assessment.
          </li>
          <li>
            More than 10 days leave will not be granted at a time but prolonged
            illness or exceptional cases supported by authentic documents could
            be considered by the Principal/Vice Principal on the basis of a
            justified and good cause.
          </li>
          <li>
            Without prior sanction of leave or any written information if a
            student remains absent from the school for more than six consecutive
            days, it is tantamount to voluntary withdrawal of the pupil by the
            parent and in such case her name will be automatically struck off
            from the attendance register. In case you wish her to re-join, it
            will be granted on written assurance that the same will not be
            repeated. An application with an explanatory reason of absence along
            with the receipt of the deposit of a fine of 2000/- at school is a
            pre-requisite for re-joining within a month from the date of
            absence.
